Astronomical dusk is a subtype of astronomical twilight. Astronomical twilight occurs when the sun is between 12° and 18° below the horizon. During this state the sun is low enough that its scattered light is less than that of starlight or other astronomical sources. Astronomical dusk occurs while the sun is setting after solar noon but before nadir.
